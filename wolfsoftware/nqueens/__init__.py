"""
This is the package initialization file.

This file is executed when the package is imported, and can be used to set up
package-level variables, import submodules, or perform any necessary
initialization for the package. Currently, this file is empty and does not
perform any actions.

By including an empty `__init__.py` file, we signal to Python that this
directory should be treated as a package, allowing us to organize our code
across multiple modules and subpackages.
